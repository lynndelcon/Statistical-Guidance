This draft aims to provide a guide to Master’s students in conducting statistical analysis during their Master thesis.  
We explain the theory and provide python codes on the most used statistical analysis throughout the paper.  
We start with the description of data (Section 3), followed by the three conditions of application for parametric tests (Section 4):  

- Independence of observations (Subsection 4.1)  
- Normality (Subsection 4.2)  
- Homogeneity of variances (Subsection 4.3)  

We then elaborate on the most frequent parametric tests:  

- Confidence interval (exact and asymptotic) (Subsection 5.1)  
- Student test (independent, Welch’s t-test and dependent) (Subsection 5.2)  
- One-way anova (classic and Welch’s anova) (Subsection 5.3)  

From those parametric tests, we provide their non parametric alternatives:  

- Sign test (Subsection 6.1)  
- Wilcoxon test (rank-sum and signed-rank) (Subsection 6.2 & 6.3)  
- Paired Sign test (Subsection 6.4)  
- Kruskal-Wallis test (Subsection 6.5)  

Finally, we conclude with some tips for the writing of the statistical part of a Master thesis.  
The following section provides an overview of the tests covered in this draft, notably, the situations specific to each test.

The following picture is a visual non-exhaustive summary of the figures and equations displayed in this draft.
